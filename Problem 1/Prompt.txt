Problem 1:
The missionaries and cannibals problem is usually stated as follows. Three missionaries and three cannibals are on
one side of a river, along with a boat that can hold one or two people. Find a way to get everyone to the other side
without ever leaving a group of missionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that place.
1. Implement and solve the problem optimally using an appropriate search algorithm. (10 points)
2. Provide the optimal path from start to goal. (3 points)
3. Is it a good idea to check for repeated states? (2 points)

There are two requirements:
    - wolves.len() <= sheep.len() for one side of the river
    - an actor must be in the boat for the boat to move across the river

There are two terminal state:
    - wolves.len() > sheep.len() for one side of the river        -1
    - All actors are on the other side of the river               +1

On each turn, exists 5 possible actions:
    - Take one missionary
    - Take two missionary

    - Take one cannibal
    - Take two cannibal

    - Take one missionary and one cannibal

Each State can be modeled by the following string:
    0000000
    : the first three 0's represent the position of the wolves
    : the next 0 represents the position of the boat
    : the last three 0's represent the position of the sheep
    0 (false) Represents that the actor is on the left
    1 (true) represents that the actor is on the right

    - The solution is found when the state description == 1111111
